> R interface to argon HTML design

## ArgonR philosophy
ArgonR primarily aims at building static webpages, without the need of shiny or server part. However,
it can be also used within shiny packages such as argonDash, a bootstrap4 shiny dashboard.
See [here](https://github.com/RinteRface/argonDash) for more details.

## Installation

```r
devtools::install_github("RinteRface/argonR")
```

## Demo

See a demonstration [here](http://130.60.24.205/example.html):

## How to host it?
This is pretty simple:
* test it locally: after having generated your HTML page as described previously, 
open it with any web browser
* On apache or nginx server: copy example.html and the inst folder to the root of your
web server. Enter the web server adress in the web browser.
* On shiny-server: copy example.html and the inst folder to the root of your
shiny-server (usually /srv/shiny-server). Enter the web server adress in the web browser

## Use with shiny
